								<h3>safe and welcoming cycling festival for all</h3>
								<p>The following code outlines the requirements for participants’ conduct on and off the road during
                                the Velotour Festival from 19 May to 21 May 2023 and is designed to offer a safe
                                and welcoming cycling festival for all regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation,
                                socioeconomic status, physical appearance, ability and religion (or lack thereof).
                                <br><br>Organizers do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form including offensive
                                language, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
                                harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
                                inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop
                                any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                                <br><br>All participants, organizers and volunteers at the Velotour Festival are required to
                                agree with the present code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the
                                event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe and
                                welcoming environment for everybody.
                                <br><br>Any conduct that breaches this code could result in actions organizers deem
                                appropriate, including warning or your removal from the Velotour Festival and
                                organizers will not be liable to refund the cost of the festival or any expenses this
                                removal incurs.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>1. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS</h4>
								<p>All participants are required to observe the law wherever we go, both on and off the bike.
                                Failure to do so will result in removal from the festival.
                                <br><br>Participants must follow all traffic rules and road rules of the <a rel="license" href="https://wegcode.be/">Belgian Traffic Code</a>. This means you have the same responsibilities as road users and must obey all traffic signals such as red lights, stop signs, etc. just as you would driving a bike on your own.
                                <br><br>Police escorting may be applicable for some parts of the tour. Instructions of the Police must
                                be followed.
                                <br><br>There's a liability and physical damage insurance for all volunteers and a basic physical damage insurance for all participants. Yet, with your registration you agree and confirm that you participate at your own risk and responsibility. You will be asked to sign a disclaimer on the first day to waive any liability claim towards the organisers.</p>
                                
                                <h4>2. GENERAL CONDUCT</h4>
								<p>Please behave on the festival as you would be at home, on holiday or on a bike trip: with
                                respect and consideration for the other participants, volunteers and organizers as well as
                                others around you. Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to
                                the community and the positive image of cycling and bike touring. Exercise consideration and
                                respect in your speech and actions. Please avoid making assumptions. Attempt collaboration
                                before conflict.
                                    
                                <br><br>More specifically you must:
                                <ul>
                                <li>Read, understand and conform with the cycling safety instructions and the Belgian
                                Traffic Code.</li>
                                <li>Report any accidents, injuries, loss or damage suffered during the festival before
                                leaving the festival.</li>
                                <li>Represent cycling and bike touring in a positive light. Organizers require you to
                                refrain from using bad language and any anti-social behavior during the festival.</li>
                                <li>Behave with respect to other participants, volunteers and organizers at all times.
                                Oppressive behavior (i.e. patriarchal, racist, sexist, etc.) discriminatory, demeaning
                                and harassing language or anti-social conduct will not be tolerated in any form.</li>
                                <li>Respect the volunteers and organizers property and that of other participants. You
                                are responsible for damage or loss you incur and are liable for replacement and
                                repair costs.</li>
                                <li>Contact the organisers immediately if you are being harassed, notice that
                                someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns.</li>
                                <li>Not litter at any time.</li>
                                <li>Keep noise to a minimum between 10pm and 7am.</li>
                                <li>Keep alcohol consumption to a reasonable level. Drunkenness or under-age drinking
                                is not tolerated and may be referred to the police.</li>
                                <li>Don't smoke within 25 meters of the meal and rest places.</li>
                                <li>Don't use drugs at the festival. Presence of drugs may be referred to the police.</li>
                                <li>Respect landowners and public space at any time. The organizers have planned
                                comfort stops along the route so please check with them – it could well be the case
                                that a comfortable toilet block is just minutes away.</li>
                                <li>Be aware that the organisers may ask you to help and act at a specific time in
                                order to keep the festival running on schedule.</li>
                                </ul> 
                                    
                                <br>Last but not least, if you agree with the code of conduct above, we are very much looking forward to welcoming you at the Velotour Festival. Please smile, relax and enjoy yourself!</p>
